- Movement: WASD or up, down, left, right arrow
- Switching weapons: Shift(Only available when you have progressed onto further stages which is reflected in the bottom right)

Conclusion: </br>
As it was the first time using Monogame and using C# in a while, there were quite a few bugs which I couldn't get fixed in time but overall an enjoyable experience
- Collision between player and some object are not always instant
- When you die, you can't reply the game and need to fully exit the application to try again
